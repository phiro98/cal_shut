              <p> A rolling shutter is a type of door or window shutter consisting of many horizontal slats (or
                sometimes bars or web systems) hinged together. The door is raised to open it and lowered to close it.

              <h3>PED Shed</h3>
              <p> Ped shed is short for pedestrian shed, the basic building block of walkable neighborhoods. A ped shed
                is an area encompassed by the walking distance from a town center, neighborhood center, or other
                location. They may be drawn as perfect circles, but in practice, ped sheds have irregular shapes because
                they cover the actual distance walked, not the straight-line distance. A synonym for ped shed is
                walkable catchment.
